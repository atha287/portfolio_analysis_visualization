# portfolio_analysis_visualization
A basic analysis and visualization of a portfolio containing several stocks: assigns random weights to each stock, shows progression of individual stock values and total portfolio net-worth over time, and volatility of the portfolio.

Visualization is done via `plotly.express`, which is a part of the `plotly` (for `python`) package for interactive plotting. More information can be obtained [here](https://plotly.com/python/).
